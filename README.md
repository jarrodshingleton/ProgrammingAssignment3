# ProgrammingAssignment3

This repository houses my Getting and Cleaning Data week 4 assignment submission. There are three files in this repository: run_analysis.R, which creates the required .txt documents for the assignment and two code_book.txt file that describes the variables in the data sets.

The run_analysis.R script is ready to go, just needs to be imported to R and can be run if you have the training and test sets in your working directory. You also must include the "feattures.txt" file for the labels for the data sets.
